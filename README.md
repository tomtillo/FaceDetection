# Face Detection using Viola-Jones Algorithm and OpenCV2

We can modify the Viola Jones Algorithm within a python script to scan for all the face-like portions of an image - Whether it is a single face in an image 
![](https://github.com/tomtillo/FaceDetection/blob/master/orig_image_24.jpg)

Or a group of faces

Order of face detection 


Detecting if the image is a closeup
1. Compare the sizes of the original Image and the area bound by face


2. Apply heuristics based on several training images - And manually classifying those training images 

Challenges 
1. Some faces do not get recognized ( see the image above - the face at the bottom right was not successfully detected )
